First thing I wrote in ClojureScript. As described:

"gives each odd number n < 10000 with the property that n_p is not forced to be
 1 by the congruence condition of Sylow's theorem"
"gives for each n the factorization into prime powers and ... all permissible
 values of n_p"
"the same process ... for all even numbers less than 1000"

This would have been simpler if I had known the language to start with.
